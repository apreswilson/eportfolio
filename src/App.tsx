        <p>
          I am currently 22 years old and attend the University of South Florida. I am expected to graduate at the end of 2024 with a bachelor&apos;s degree in information science with a concentration in Web Development. I was born and currently still reside in Clearwater, Florida. My primary language is English; however, I do have a basic understanding of the Spanish language as well.

          My area of interest revolves around the field of web application development. I enjoy the process and learning about all the different aspects that go into making a fully functional web application for users on the Internet to access and use for its intended purpose. Various components such as stack, data structuring, UI/UX, CI/CD, and the actual process of programming the web application are all crucial components that I work to improve my understanding of regularly.

          Some of the classes I have taken throughout my program at USF have helped to shape these foundational skills required to venture into the world of web application development. Regarding programming languages, I have taken classes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++. In my relational database class I learned about the crucial nature of structuring your databases to effectively store information in a database. In my information architecture class, I learned about how to focus on the user experience when it comes to designing and laying out a web application.

          I have a range of skills in various languages in technologies that allow me the ability to make a web application. Regarding languages, I am proficient in the 3 core languages, that being HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I do most of my projects in TypeScript though. In addition, I also have proficiency in the CSS pre-processor SASS and Python as well as a basic understanding of Java, C++, and C. When it comes to technology, I utilize GitHub CI/CD for my code, React as the UI library, Node.js as the environment, and MongoDB as the database platform. I am planning on exploring SQL databases such as PostgreSQL. I also have branched out into using technologies such as Astro, Docker for containerizing, and NextJS environment for making full stack React applications. Regarding more general office applications, I have a certification for Microsoft Office Specialist that I took back in high school.

          I have a various list of work and volunteer experience. My first job I was hired at in 2016 was Publix Supermarkets as a customer service employee. My second job, that initially began as an internship, that I started in 2021 was database management and web development for Westlake Christian School. My third and most recent job I got hired for in 2023 is an invoice specialist for Label IT technologies. I currently still work for Publix and Label IT and worked for Westlake until late 2023. I have also done an internship for Lockheed Martin helping with database management and physical organizing of stencil parts.
