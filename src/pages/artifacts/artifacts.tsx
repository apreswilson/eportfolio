         <h1>Career Aspirations Essay</h1>
         <p>
            My major area of study is information science with a concentration in web development. This major is relevant to my career aspiration. My career aspiration is to become a software developer of some kind. This can be either a front-end developer or a full stack developer. I am not too particular on which one, as I enjoy both the front-end side and full stack side of the development process of web applications. This is the role I envision myself working in in my upcoming future career. The origins of how I became passionate about web development goes back to when I was in 7th grade. I took my first web design class, and I knew by taking that class I was going to do that for a career. It was a fascinating thing to make a website purely by hand and I really enjoyed the creative process that went into it as well.

            I do have brief work experience in web development. When I worked for Westlake Christian School, I worked alongside someone to help add content to the school’s website. The school used a CMS provider called FACTS to host their website. My job was to go through the CMS and add relevant content depending on the request of my manager. My non-work experience related to web development is the various projects I have made and host the source code on my GitHub account.

            Prior to this assignment, I had not visited the USF career services website. However, I do find this website useful after visiting. It has a wide range of resources available for students’ seeking information or opportunities to browse. The most interesting aspect to me is the career fairs that they have going on. This is appealing because I have yet to go to one, but they do seem like a great opportunity for those who are looking to meet directly with employers and other alike minds trying to work for a company. Therefore, I do plan on attending one of these for Technology and Engineering in the future.

            I do have various internship experiences dating all throughout my duration at college and even high school. As mentioned, prior, I did an internship as a web developer at Westlake Christian School. I was eventually added as an employee and did database management for them for around another year until December 2023. Another internship I did was at Lockheed Martin. I completed it through a dual enrollment class my senior year of high school called the executive internship program. During my time there, I helped them with database management for parts used in the development areas, as well as organizing physical stencil boards and SMT parts. Regarding other actual jobs, I have worked at Publix as a customer service employee since 2016 when I was 14 years old, and currently still work there today. Additionally, I have also worked as an invoice specialist for Label IT technologies for over a year now. I work these two jobs simultaneously as well as attending USF.

            I have done a very length amount of research into the world of web application development. There are tons of resources I utilize such as W3schools, FreeCodeCamp, GeeksForGeeks, and many more. I have also taken an extensive number of notes on things such as data structures and algorithms. USF library resources have not been used often for me when it comes to researching for my career, as that usually contains more study related information, whereas I am searching for documentation and tutorials. In my time researching web development, I have learned about a very large number of things to varying degrees. To name a few, I have learned about ReactJS, HTML and CSS fundamentals, JavaScript, MongoDB, and  common data structures and algorithms used to solve coding problems. There are many more things that I have learned about throughout my time researching the world of web development that could be an essay itself.

         <p>
            My plans towards progressing towards my career are to continue to work on my software development projects, and research job requirements for a lot of companies so I can tailor what I am learning about to hirable skills. For instance, I will be doing more research into SQL and relational database structuring as my own current experience is document-based NoSQL databases. Additionally, I will be working on my first full stack application to improve my skills and become hirable as a full stack developer instead of just a front-end developer.

         <h1>Project Management Plan</h1>
         <p>
            This essay will cover the specific implementation plan of a software-tracking database for a college. This database will be used and maintained by the IT department of the institution. There are six steps that will be the guiding principles for the implementation plan. In start to finish order they are the initiation phase, definition phase, design phase, development phase, implementation phase, and follow-up phase. Basic information about each software must be available such as the type, the developer, different versions, the types of licensing agreements, what departments use it, the computers in the departments on which the software is installed, and the installation dates. The stakeholders in this scenario are the IT department of the college, as well as those who will use it that are outside of the IT department for various reasons.
         </p>
         <p>
            Starting off with the initiation phase, the database will be a Microsoft Excel database. This is because it is cost effective, simple for people to understand, and easily learnable/editable by the members working on it. The team consisting of the development process will be 5 people, me included. The database will have a user interface tab where the audience will be able to query the database depending on the parameter they are looking for. This will make the database user friendly to a wide range of audiences due to Excel being extremely widespread in its understanding. The user interface tab will also include instructions for how to use it for those who are not previously exposed to Excel.
         </p>
         <p>
            Moving onto the definition phase, the excel database will be organized so that each specific software will have its own row in the database, and each column will be the basic information specified in the introduction. This project will have to remain within the bounds of Excel due to XLSX being a very specific format that isn’t accepted by all platforms. In addition, Excel is an extremely widespread software that many people are familiar with, promoting ease of usability. The database itself will be accessible via a shared document to each member of the staff who needs access to it.
         </p>
         <p>
            Moving on to the design phase, there will be three major components. That will be the user interface, the user query, and the actual database. The user interface will send a request based on the query, the query will then be processed in the background, then the specific queried section of the database will be returned to the user interface as a response. Below is a simple diagram of the process.
         </p>

         <p>
            Transitioning into the development phase, all members on the team will be organized, and a timeline will be broken down into phases. All computers that will be worked on for the development process of the database will be selected. Two of the four other members will be assigned to collect the actual data for the database, and the other two will be responsible for programming and designing the actual database. I will act as a supporting role for both groups when deemed necessary and provide oversight.
         </p>
         <p>
            Upon arriving at the implementation phase, the database will be actively being developed, including programmatic features will be written in Visual Basic (VBA). The two collectors will be traveling to each department and actively gathering information, populating and updating database fields with each new list of information they receive. I will be regularly checking in on the progress of both the programmers/designers and the data collectors, making sure that the project is staying on track and heading towards being finished within a reasonable timeframe.
         </p>
         <p>
            Finally, the follow-up phase will include brief training for people who will be regularly using the database for any necessary purposes and making sure that the functionality of the database works clearly, and that error handling is present. We will also allow stakeholders to give us feedback on their experience using the database when they are being trained. This will give us insight as to whether our product came out as desired or not. Last, I will also ask the head of the IT department to contact me if there are any troubles that they run into with the database, as well as providing special training to them to show them how to update the database itself and allow them to determine who needs to be trained for that role.
         </p>
         <p>
            In conclusion, the database implementation plan is divided into six steps, with each section laid out in specific detail as to the process of creating the database. This originates all the way from it just being an idea, to the follow-up process after the database has been developed. Since the database itself is quite simple in its architecture and actual process, it is versatile to more nuanced and specific details that this implementation plan potentially overlooks.
