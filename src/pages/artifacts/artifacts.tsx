         <h1>Career Aspirations Essay</h1>
         <p>
            My major area of study is information science with a concentration in web development. This major is relevant to my career aspiration. My career aspiration is to become a software developer of some kind. This can be either a front-end developer or a full stack developer. I am not too particular on which one, as I enjoy both the front-end side and full stack side of the development process of web applications. This is the role I envision myself working in in my upcoming future career. The origins of how I became passionate about web development goes back to when I was in 7th grade. I took my first web design class, and I knew by taking that class I was going to do that for a career. It was a fascinating thing to make a website purely by hand and I really enjoyed the creative process that went into it as well.

            I do have brief work experience in web development. When I worked for Westlake Christian School, I worked alongside someone to help add content to the school’s website. The school used a CMS provider called FACTS to host their website. My job was to go through the CMS and add relevant content depending on the request of my manager. My non-work experience related to web development is the various projects I have made and host the source code on my GitHub account.

            Prior to this assignment, I had not visited the USF career services website. However, I do find this website useful after visiting. It has a wide range of resources available for students’ seeking information or opportunities to browse. The most interesting aspect to me is the career fairs that they have going on. This is appealing because I have yet to go to one, but they do seem like a great opportunity for those who are looking to meet directly with employers and other alike minds trying to work for a company. Therefore, I do plan on attending one of these for Technology and Engineering in the future.

            I do have various internship experiences dating all throughout my duration at college and even high school. As mentioned, prior, I did an internship as a web developer at Westlake Christian School. I was eventually added as an employee and did database management for them for around another year until December 2023. Another internship I did was at Lockheed Martin. I completed it through a dual enrollment class my senior year of high school called the executive internship program. During my time there, I helped them with database management for parts used in the development areas, as well as organizing physical stencil boards and SMT parts. Regarding other actual jobs, I have worked at Publix as a customer service employee since 2016 when I was 14 years old, and currently still work there today. Additionally, I have also worked as an invoice specialist for Label IT technologies for over a year now. I work these two jobs simultaneously as well as attending USF.

            I have done a very length amount of research into the world of web application development. There are tons of resources I utilize such as W3schools, FreeCodeCamp, GeeksForGeeks, and many more. I have also taken an extensive number of notes on things such as data structures and algorithms. USF library resources have not been used often for me when it comes to researching for my career, as that usually contains more study related information, whereas I am searching for documentation and tutorials. In my time researching web development, I have learned about a very large number of things to varying degrees. To name a few, I have learned about ReactJS, HTML and CSS fundamentals, JavaScript, MongoDB, and  common data structures and algorithms used to solve coding problems. There are many more things that I have learned about throughout my time researching the world of web development that could be an essay itself.

            My plans towards progressing towards my career are to continue to work on my software development projects, and research job requirements for a lot of companies so I can tailor what I am learning about to hirable skills. For instance, I will be doing more research into SQL and relational database structuring as my own current experience is document-based NoSQL databases. Additionally, I will be working on my first full stack application to improve my skills and become hirable as a full stack developer instead of just a front-end developer.
